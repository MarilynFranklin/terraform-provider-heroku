# heroku\_build

Provides a [Heroku Build](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#build)
resource.

## Example Usage with Remote Source

* The `source.url` is only fetched during resource creation. To trigger another fetch the `source.url` should be changed, then a new resource will be forced on the next plan/apply.

```hcl
resource "heroku_app" "foobar" {
    name = "foobar"
    region = "us"
}

resource "heroku_build" "foobar" {
  app = "${heroku_app.foobar.id}"
  buildpacks = ["mars/create-react-app"]
  
  source = {
    url     = "https://github.com/mars/cra-example-app/archive/v2.1.1.tar.gz"
    version = "v2.1.1"
  }
}

resource "heroku_formation" "foobar" {
  app        = "${heroku_app.foobar.id}"
  type       = "web"
  quantity   = 1
  size       = "Standard-1x"
  depends_on = ["heroku_build.foobar.release"]
}
```

## Example Usage with Local Source

* If the content (SHA256) of `source.path` changes, then a new resource will be forced on the next plan/apply; if the file does not exist, the difference is ignored.

```hcl
resource "heroku_app" "foobar" {
    name = "foobar"
    region = "us"
}

resource "heroku_build" "foobar" {
  app = "${heroku_app.foobar.id}"
  buildpacks = ["heroku/ruby"]
  
  source = {
    path    = "sources/app-v1.tgz"
    version = "v1"
  }
}

resource "heroku_formation" "foobar" {
  app        = "${heroku_app.foobar.id}"
  type       = "web"
  quantity   = 1
  size       = "Standard-1x"
  depends_on = ["heroku_build.foobar.release"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `app` - (Required) The ID of the Heroku app
* `buildpacks` - List of buildpack registry names and/or GitHub URLs
* `source` - (Required) A block that specifies the source code to build & release:
  * `checksum` - Hash of the source archive for verifying its integrity, auto-generated when `source.path` is set, `SHA256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`
  * `path` - (Required unless `source.url` is set) Local path to the source archive for the app. If the contents (SHA) change
  * `url` - (Required unless `source.path` is set) `https` location of the source archive for the app
  * `version` - Use to track what version of your source originated this build. If you are creating builds from git-versioned source code, for example, the commit hash, or release tag would be a good value to use for the version parameter.
* `source_path` - (Required unless `source` is set)


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `uuid` - The ID of the build
* `output_stream_url` - URL that [streams the log output from the build](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-and-release-using-the-api#streaming-build-output)
* `release` - The Heroku app release created with a build's slug
  * `id`
* `slug` - The Heroku slug created by a build
  * `id`
* `stack` - Name or ID of the [Heroku stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack)
* `status` - The status of a build. Possible values are `pending`, `successful` and `failed`
* `user` - Heroku account that created a build
  * `email`
  * `id`

## Import
Existing builds can be imported using the combination of the application name, a colon, and the build ID.

For example:
```
$ terraform import heroku_build.foobar bazbux:4f1db8ef-ed5c-4c42-a3d6-3c28262d5abc
```

* `foobar` is the **heroku_build** resource's name
* `bazbux` is the Heroku app name (or ID) that the build belongs to
* `:` separates the app identifier & the build identifier
* `4f1db8efâ€¦` is the build ID
